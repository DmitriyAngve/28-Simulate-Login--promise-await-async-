# 28-Simulate-Login--promise-await-async

In this small example i practice with simulate a simple login (this is not to be secure login).

I have two JSON files where i've got the users and the passwords. The passwords are encoded.

Please use JSON files to try a login, and try it with wrong user/password.

I practiced to fetching data, ouputting it on the page, manipulation with DOM and validation of inputs.

Unpretentious style included!
